- 👋 Hi, we’re [@SWWSpaceClub](https://github.com/SWWSpaceClub), the School Without Walls High School Space Club in Washington, DC!
- 👀 We’re interested in space exploration and rocketry.
- 🌱 We’re currently learning how to build a 1,000 cubic-centimeter satellite in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Beaver Works Summer Institute’s 2024 Build a CubeSat Challenge.
- 💞️ We’re looking to collaborate on projects in space and rocketry.
- 📫 How to reach me: swwaerospaceclub@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: We refounded our club after 3 years of inactivity due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic but have been going strong with our engagement in the 2023 Inaugural DC Space Summit and NASA DC Space Apps Challenge Local Impact Award!
